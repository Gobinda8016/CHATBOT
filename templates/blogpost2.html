            <p>Congratulations on taking a forward step to get in shape and feel great. Many people are guilty of
                wishing they could get a sculpted body from eating junk food and watching TV all day. But that is just
                not going to happen. Even though getting in shape sounds like a long, time-wasting process, the effort
                put towards being in shape has many positive effects. If you want to start your journey to having a
                better body to feel great, here are some tips:
            </p>

            <img src="../static/images/Exercise.jpg" class="inline-img" alt="a man drinking water">

            <h2>1. Exercise Daily</h2>

            <p>Exercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc.,
                but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking
                to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk
                pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure you're
                not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity
                workout.
                It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated,
                stretch,
                and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each workout. The protein will help keep your
                muscles, not
                fat, rebuilding.</p>
            <h2>2. Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal</h2>
            <p>No matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from
                sweets.
                Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if it's just a single candy bar, one will
                eventually lead to another.
                Fruits and vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting into shape. Apples, for example, do a good
                job at making the
                stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4 hours. Green vegetables such as green beans and broccoli keep the
                digestive system clean and running.<br>
                Also, stick to lean meats like turkey and chicken. Seafood, such as, shrimp, and tilapia are also great
                alternatives.
                These foods are full of protein and healthy nutrients to help keep muscles fit and ready for workouts.
                In addition, be sure to
                portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism comes from portioning meals. Try to plan out eating six
                times a day and setting
                smaller portions, rather than having three large meals throughout the day. This will also help you find
                yourself breathing smoother
                when working out rather than huffing and puffing for air. This is because you will have less food in
                your digestive system, which
                means more energy is used toward your exercise.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day</h2>
            <p>Keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical exercising. 
               Ever wonder why body builders' body masses are so big? That's because they plan out their meals and take in more 
               (healthy) calories than the average person. On the other hand, losing weight and striving for a skinnier physique 
               will involve more physical exercise than calories you ingest.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Be Sure to Get Sleep</h2>
            <p>Even though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough sleep to recharge 
                the body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going throughout the day, but if you happen 
                to feel tired at any point after coming home from work, by all means take a small nap before exercising. You should 
                only nap for about a half hour. This will prevent you from staying up later in the night.
            </p>
            <h2>5. Stay Motivated</h2>
            <p>An important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive, you will be able 
                to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.
